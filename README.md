## What

*Using GitHub, we can collaborate on writing a story together and track all the authors and changes. Itâ€™s the open source way!*

## Halp

Looking for help? Feel free to [browse existing issues](https://github.com/mozfest/our-story/issues?state=open), or [open a new one](https://github.com/mozfest/our-story/issues/new)

## How

Take a look at [the live site](http://mozfest.github.io/our-story/#instructions) for instructions.

## Under the hood

This repository represents a static [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) site, which is rebuilt after each change. Each story is represented by a post in the `_posts` folder, and is listed on the index in reverse chronological order.

Each story should use the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.md`, and should contain the field `author` in the YAML front matter. See [this story](https://raw.github.com/mozfest/our-story/gh-pages/_posts/2013-10-22-example-post.md) as an example.
